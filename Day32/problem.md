# Day 31: Maximum Difference Between Adjacent Elements in a Circular Array

**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Topics:** Arrays, Math  
**Companies:** (Premium)  
**Hint:** Think about the circular property carefully and iterate over all adjacent pairs including the last and first elements.

---

## Problem Statement

Given a circular array `nums`, find the **maximum absolute difference** between adjacent elements.

> **Note**: In a circular array, the **first and last** elements are also considered adjacent.

> **Note**: In a circular array, the **first and last** elements are also considered adjacent.

## Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:**
nums = [1, 2, 4]

**Output:**
3

**Explanation:**  
Because `nums` is circular, `nums[0]` and `nums[2]` are adjacent.  
They have the maximum absolute difference of `|4 - 1| = 3`.

---

### Example 2:

**Input:**
nums = [-5, -10, -5]

**Output:**
5

**Explanation:**  
The adjacent elements `nums[0]` and `nums[1]` have the maximum absolute difference of `|-5 - (-10)| = 5`.

---

## Constraints

- `2 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `-100 <= nums[i] <= 100`
