## Problem

You are visiting a farm that has a single row of fruit trees arranged from left to right.  
The trees are represented by an integer array `fruits` where `fruits[i]` is the type of fruit the `i`-th tree produces.

You want to collect **as much fruit as possible**. However, the owner has **strict rules** you must follow:

- You only have **two baskets**, and each basket can only hold **one type of fruit**.
- There is **no limit** on the amount of fruit each basket can hold.
- Starting from **any tree**, you must pick **exactly one fruit from every tree** (including the start tree) while moving **to the right**.
- The picked fruits must fit in **one of your baskets**.
- Once you reach a tree with fruit that **cannot fit** in your baskets, you must **stop**.

> Given the integer array `fruits`, return the **maximum number of fruits** you can pick.

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input**:  
`fruits = [1, 2, 1]`

**Output**:  
`3`

**Explanation**:  
We can pick from all 3 trees: `[1, 2, 1]`.

---

### Example 2

**Input**:  
`fruits = [0, 1, 2, 2]`

**Output**:  
`3`

**Explanation**:  
We can pick from trees `[1, 2, 2]`.  
If we had started at the first tree, we would only get `[0, 1]`.

---

### Example 3

**Input**:  
`fruits = [1, 2, 3, 2, 2]`

**Output**:  
`4`

**Explanation**:  
We can pick from trees `[2, 3, 2, 2]`.  
If we started at the first tree, weâ€™d only pick from `[1, 2]`.

## Constraints

- `1 <= fruits.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= fruits[i] < fruits.length`
