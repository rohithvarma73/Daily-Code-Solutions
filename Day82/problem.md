## Problem

You are given an integer `n`.  
We can reorder its digits in any order (including the original order) such that the **leading digit is not zero**.

Return **true** if and only if we can reorder the digits so that the resulting number is a **power of two**.

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input**:  
`n = 1`  
**Output**:  
`true`

---

### Example 2
**Input**:  
`n = 10`  
**Output**:  
`false`

---

## Constraints
- `1 <= n <= 10^9`

ds generating permutations and keeps the solution efficient.
