**Difficulty:** Hard  
**Topics:** Trie, Greedy, Binary Search

---

## Problem Statement

Given two integers `n` and `k`, return the `k`-th lexicographically smallest integer in the range `[1, n]`.

---

## Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:**

n = 13, k = 2


**Output:**

10


**Explanation:**

The lexicographical order of numbers from `1` to `13` is:

[1, 10, 11, 12, 13, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

The 2nd smallest number in this order is `10`.

---

### Example 2:

**Input:**

n = 1, k = 1


**Output:**

1


---

## Constraints

- `1 <= k <= n <= 10^9`
