# 🚀 Daily Code Solutions by Rohith Varma

Welcome to my **Daily Code Solutions** repository! This is my personal challenge to **solve and share one problem every single day** — with clear explanations and code — to help **beginners and college students** strengthen their problem-solving skills.

## 🙋‍♂️ About Me

Hi, I'm **Rohith Varma**, a 22-year-old B.Tech student from **SRM University, Chennai**, currently in my pre-final year (Graduating in 2025).  
I'm passionate about **JavaScript, TypeScript, React, scalable systems**, and all things **problem-solving**.  

I believe consistency beats talent, and this repo is my way of showing up every day — not just for myself, but for anyone starting their coding journey. 🚀
