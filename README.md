## 🙋‍♂️ About Me

Hi, I'm **Rohith Varma**, a 21-year-old B.Tech student from **SRM University, Chennai**, currently in my pre-final year (Graduating in 2025).  
I'm passionate about **JavaScript, TypeScript, React, scalable systems**, and all things **problem-solving**.  

I believe consistency beats talent, and this repo is my way of showing up every day — not just for myself, but for anyone starting their coding journey. 🚀
