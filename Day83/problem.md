## Problem

Given a positive integer `n`, there exists a **0-indexed array** called `powers`, composed of the **minimum number of powers of 2** that sum to `n`.  
The array is sorted in non-decreasing order, and there is only **one way** to form the array.

You are also given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `queries`, where `queries[i] = [left_i, right_i]`.  
Each query represents finding the **product** of all `powers[j]` with `left_i <= j <= right_i`.

Return an array `answers`, where `answers[i]` is the result for the `i`-th query.  
Since the result may be large, return each value **modulo 10^9 + 7**.

## Example 1
**Input**:  
`n = 15`  
`queries = [[0,1],[2,2],[0,3]]`  

**Output**:  
`[2, 4, 64]`  

**Explanation**:  
- For `n = 15`, `powers = [1, 2, 4, 8]` (binary decomposition).
- Query 1: `powers[0] * powers[1] = 1 * 2 = 2`  
- Query 2: `powers[2] = 4`  
- Query 3: `1 * 2 * 4 * 8 = 64`  

Modulo 1e9+7 â†’ same results: `[2, 4, 64]`

---

## Example 2
**Input**:  
`n = 2`  
`queries = [[0,0]]`  

**Output**:  
`[2]`  

**Explanation**:  
`powers = [2]`  
Only query: `powers[0] = 2`

---

## Constraints
- `1 <= n <= 10^9`
- `1 <= queries.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= start_i <= end_i < powers.length`
