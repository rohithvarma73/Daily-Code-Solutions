## Problem

You are given two arrays of integers, `fruits` and `baskets`, each of length `n`, where:

- `fruits[i]` represents the **quantity** of the `i`-th type of fruit.
- `baskets[j]` represents the **capacity** of the `j`-th basket.

You must place the fruits from **left to right**, using the following rules:

- Each fruit type must be placed in the **leftmost available basket** with a capacity **greater than or equal** to the quantity of that fruit type.
- **Each basket can hold only one type of fruit**.
- If a fruit type **cannot be placed** in any basket, it remains **unplaced**.

### Return the **number of fruit types** that remain **unplaced** after all possible allocations are made.

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input**:  
`fruits = [4,2,5]`  
`baskets = [3,5,4]`  

**Output**: `1`

**Explanation**:  
- `fruits[0] = 4` is placed in `baskets[1] = 5`.  
- `fruits[1] = 2` is placed in `baskets[0] = 3`.  
- `fruits[2] = 5` **cannot be placed** in `baskets[2] = 4`.  
So, 1 fruit type remains unplaced â†’ **Output: 1**

---

### Example 2

**Input**:  
`fruits = [3,6,1]`  
`baskets = [6,4,7]`

**Output**: `0`

**Explanation**:  
- `fruits[0] = 3` is placed in `baskets[0] = 6`.  
- `fruits[1] = 6` **cannot** be placed in `baskets[1] = 4`, but can be placed in `baskets[2] = 7`.  
- `fruits[2] = 1` is placed in `baskets[1] = 4`.  
All fruits placed successfully â†’ **Output: 0**

---

## Constraints

- `n == fruits.length == baskets.length`
- `1 <= n <= 100`
- `1 <= fruits[i], baskets[i] <= 1000`
